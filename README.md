### About
Exploratory Data Analysis on white wines

The following exploratory data analysis will use R to explore 4,898 white wines of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine variety. There are 11 attributes in the data set, and a quality score that grades the quality of the wine on a scale of 0 to 10. I will explore the data, trying to determine what attributes contribute or detract from obtaining a high quality score.

First I will perform a univariate analysis to determine the distribution of a single variable. Next, I will try a bivariate analysis, looking at the relationship between two variables. Finally, I will perform multivariate analysis to see if there are a few features that may explain white wine quality.
